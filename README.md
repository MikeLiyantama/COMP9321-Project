# COMP9321-Project

## Introduction

In this assignment, we completed a web app based on a heart diease dataset and use machine learning algorithms to make predictions on important factors relevant to heart dieases.

Firstly,we divide our project into two part: backend and frontend.
Secondly,we use Machine Learning - decision tree algorithm to make prediction. 
Then we use cross validation method to increase the accuracy of our predict result.
Besides, frontend is another part of this project for the service to users. 
 
## Tasks
 - **Dataset Collection**
 - **Frontend**
 - **Machine Learning**
 - **Optimization algorithm**
 - **API**
 
## Frame
 - Frontend
 - Backend
 - README.md

## RawData
Dataset from http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9321/19T1/assn/heart.tar.

## DataCleaning
 - Convert data to csv format
 - Drop Invalid Data
 - Fill Missing Data By Median or Average

## ModelsTrainning
 - Building decision tree model to make prediction
   To model decision tree classifier we used the information gain, and entropy split criteria.We also calucalte the accuracy of our decision tree model.

## Optimization Algorithm
 - Use Cross-validation method to improve accuracy of prediction

## Cluster for bonus
 - Use Kmeans and PCA method to cluster features
 
## Frontend
 - Use javascript to building frontend interface
 
## API
 - Use python to create api functions

## Communication Chanel
 - mobile app Whatsapp in English
 - comments on github
