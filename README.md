# COMP9321-Project

## Introduction

![](https://flic.kr/p/2epsBrN)

In this assignment, we completed a web app based on a heart diease dataset and use machine learning algorithms to make predictions on important factors relevant to heart dieases.

Firstly,we divide our project into two part: backend and frontend.
Secondly,we use Machine Learning - decision tree algorithm to make prediction. 
Then we use cross validation method to increase the accuracy of our predict result.
Besides, frontend is another part of this project for the service to users.
